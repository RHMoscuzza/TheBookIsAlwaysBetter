// Input field where users input name of a movie (required)
	// (if no movie exists / can be found - do something - but we will have autocomplete to avoid this problem)
// On submit: Searches the TMDB database for movies with the same title
// Displays list of 4 movie possibilities. User clicks on the movie they want.
// Connect to Google Books API and return one book that matches the movie (maybe top result / index 0 of the Google Books response)
// also look at page count of book to determine length

// Also display a paragraph (of 100 words) for user to time themselves reading
// Timer on the designated paragraph. User can hit start to begin, and then stop once they finish reading it.
// When click on start, timer starts (visible to user)
// Option to reset timer
// When click stop, timer stops - we store the number into a variable: UserTime.
// Calculation based on:
	250-300 words per page
	55,000 words per novel (200 pages)*
	*if book is longer than this do math to fix the word count

// Reading Speed: Measured in words per minute. Function: ReadingSPeed to Take number of words and divide by UserTime
// Display Reading Speed: reading speed is displayed.
// Input field: "How much time will you spend reading each day?" User inputs a number
// Take that value and store it in a variable: UserFreeTime

// Calculate how long it takes to read the book based on UserFreeTime and ReadingSpeed
	readingSpeed = Words / minute
	bookAvg = 250 words / page
	totalPages = x pages / book (in pages)
	
	using math, determine:
	totalWords = totalPages * bookAvg (in words)
	totalTimeToRead = totalWords / readingSpeed (in time)
	freeTimePerDay = minutes
	
	total days totalTimeToRead / freeTimePerDay

// A paragraph is displayed to the user that shows the results
// Also included is an average result (so user can compare their results to the average person)
// (Disclaimer: Numbers may be slightly inaccurate)
